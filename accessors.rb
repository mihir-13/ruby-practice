# Accessors are a way to create getter and 
# setter methods without explicitly defining them 
# in a class.

# there are three type of Accessors
# 1. attr_reader // Getter, it will prevent us to write getter method manually
# 2. attr_writer // setter, it will prevent to write setter manually
# 3. attr_accessor // it will work as both getter and setter
